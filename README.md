# CatchMeIfYouCan - Malware Analysis Challenge
This room presents a complete infection chain that will help you develop your script-based malware analysis and deobfuscation techniques.

## Scenario: 
QuantumX is a space research company focused on discovering and 
advancing technologies related to space and stars. 
Yoav, the head of the Research Department, received a suspicious email 
claiming to contain details of a groundbreaking discovery. After opening the 
attachment, he noticed unusual system behaviour. Yoav immediately 
reported the incident and forwarded the email to the MDR team for further 
investigation. As a member of the MDR team, your task is to investigate the 
incident and determine what happened. 

## Warning: 
This challenge involves a malware sample. While most stages were 
developed by me and are harmless, some components include real 
malicious behavior that could potentially cause damage. Please ensure 
you analyze everything in a controlled and isolated environment (e.g., 
VM, sandbox) to avoid unintended consequences.

## Passwords: 
The password for Challenge.zip is: **infected** 
If youâ€™ve decided to view the solutions and write-up, the password for the ZIP file is: 
**ILostToBase64**.

## Important Note:
In case one of the stages fetched from the remote URL is down, the payload is included in the ZIP file **"Write-up && Answers.zip"**. Simply use that instead of fetching it from the remote URL.
